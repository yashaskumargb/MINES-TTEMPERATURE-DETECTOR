#Description

Hello Everyone,

This project was developed as apart of hackathon conducted by ELSOC BMSCE in 2020.
Input devices:
  NTC temperature sensor - This monitors the ambient temeperature inside the mine.
Output devices:
  LCD display -  Disaply current temeprature range and alert notifications
  Motor - Cooling Unit
  Green Led - for <=30 degree Celsius
  Blue Led - for >30 & <=40 degree Celsius
  Red Led - for >40 & <=50 degree Celsius
  Buzzer - Sound Alram

Working
Temperature sensor continously monitors the ambient temperature inside mine. Same value will be disaleyed in LCD dispaly.
Once temperature crosses 40deg C,cooling fan turns ON to reduce the inside the rempeature.
